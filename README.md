- this group aim to support tech remote workers to find a place to stay in a new bright city enjoying everything it has to offer and after that returning to their own place as safe and easy as possible.

- we do not mediate nor secure any exchange held in here, the whole process is carried by both parts involved solely. we just try to keep a select group of members.

- we do not envision any kind of financial profit but please let's keep posts to a high standard with good descriptions and high quality pictures.

- we realized that in order to create a sustainable economic model for both parts involved in the renting process the ideal period to rent your home is anywhere between fifteen to thirty days. it keeps things simple and easy to everybody.

- we do not encourage shorter or longer renting periods because we think this can bring a lot of overhead to the experience.
